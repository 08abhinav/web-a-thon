An escrow system in a freelancing or job marketplace platform acts as a secure intermediary that holds the client's payment in a secure account until the project is completed to the agreed terms. This ensures that freelancers are confident they’ll be paid once they deliver the work, and clients are assured they’ll only release funds when satisfied with the work.

### **How the Escrow System Works in Freelancing Platforms**

1. **Initial Payment**: When a project is accepted, the client deposits the full or partial payment into an escrow account managed by the platform. This money is held securely and cannot be accessed by the freelancer until the project is completed.
2. **Milestone Setup (Optional)**: Projects are often broken down into milestones. Funds for each milestone can be released upon completion, rather than waiting until the full project is completed. 
3. **Work Delivery and Approval**: Once the freelancer completes a milestone or the entire project, they submit it for client review. The client then has a set period to review the work.
4. **Payment Release**: If the client is satisfied, they approve the release of funds, which are then transferred from the escrow account to the freelancer’s account.
5. **Dispute Resolution**: If there’s a disagreement on the work quality or completion, the platform can have a dispute resolution system to review the case and decide on releasing funds. 

### **How to Include an Escrow System in Your App**

1. **Use a Payment Gateway with Escrow Support**: Many payment gateways (like Stripe, PayPal, or Mangopay) provide escrow or payment-holding services, allowing you to manage funds without needing to be a licensed financial institution.
   
2. **Database Setup for Escrow Transactions**:
   - Create a table to track escrow transactions, including fields like `transaction_id`, `client_id`, `freelancer_id`, `amount`, `status` (e.g., "funded," "in-progress," "released," "disputed"), and `project_id`.
   - Include milestones if needed, where each milestone has a corresponding escrow status.

3. **Escrow Workflow in Code**:
   - **Funding Escrow**: When a client funds a project, make a call to the payment gateway’s API to hold the funds and update the transaction status in the database to "funded."
   - **Work Submission**: Once the freelancer submits the work, notify the client and display an option to either approve or dispute the submission.
   - **Release or Dispute**: On approval, trigger an API call to release the funds from escrow to the freelancer's account, then update the transaction status to "released." If disputed, flag the transaction for platform intervention.

4. **User Interface (UI) Integration**:
   - **Client Side**: Display clear instructions on funding and releasing escrow payments. Include notifications and buttons for project funding, reviewing submissions, and approving/releasing payment.
   - **Freelancer Side**: Show payment status (funded, pending release, released) to keep freelancers informed on the progress.
   - **Admin Panel**: Implement an admin view to monitor transactions and handle disputes if clients flag work as unsatisfactory.

5. **Security and Compliance**:
   - Ensure secure storage of sensitive data, like transaction records and user credentials, in compliance with regulations (e.g., PCI-DSS for payment security).
   - Implement two-factor authentication and role-based access control to manage sensitive operations like fund release.

### **Example Workflow Code (Using Node.js & Stripe)**

Here’s a basic example to illustrate how you might set up an escrow transaction using Stripe (adjust based on the payment gateway you choose):

```javascript
const stripe = require('stripe')('your-stripe-secret-key');

// Step 1: Client funds the escrow account
async function fundEscrow(clientId, amount, projectId) {
    const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
        amount: amount,
        currency: 'inr',
        payment_method_types: ['card'],
        capture_method: 'manual' // Authorize payment but don't capture yet
    });

    // Save the transaction in your database
    await EscrowTransaction.create({
        clientId,
        projectId,
        amount,
        status: 'funded',
        paymentIntentId: paymentIntent.id
    });

    return paymentIntent.client_secret; // Send client_secret to the client to complete payment
}

// Step 2: Releasing payment to freelancer
async function releaseEscrow(transactionId) {
    const transaction = await EscrowTransaction.findById(transactionId);

    if (transaction.status === 'funded') {
        await stripe.paymentIntents.capture(transaction.paymentIntentId);
        transaction.status = 'released';
        await transaction.save();

        // Notify the freelancer and log the release
        // (e.g., send email, update frontend status)
    } else {
        throw new Error('Transaction not in funded status');
    }
}

// Step 3: Handling Disputes
async function disputeEscrow(transactionId) {
    const transaction = await EscrowTransaction.findById(transactionId);

    if (transaction.status === 'funded') {
        transaction.status = 'disputed';
        await transaction.save();
        // Implement additional dispute handling logic here
    } else {
        throw new Error('Transaction not in funded status');
    }
}
```

This code includes basic steps:
- **Fund Escrow**: Initiates an escrow transaction by creating a payment intent in `fundEscrow` that isn’t immediately captured.
- **Release Escrow**: Once approved, `releaseEscrow` captures the payment, releasing funds to the freelancer.
- **Dispute Escrow**: Flags a transaction as disputed, setting up additional handling if necessary.

**Note**: Integrating an escrow system requires strict adherence to financial compliance and regulations.
